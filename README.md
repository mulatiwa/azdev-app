#AZdev Web App

##Project Description
AZdev is short for "A to Z" of developer resources

AZdev is a searchable library of practical micro-documentation, errors, solutions and general tips, that software developers may perform on a day-to-day basis.

It is a library of what developers usually look up, a quick way for them to find concise approaches to to certain software development tasks.

The particular thing developers would like to do is known as a Task, while process of performing that Task is known as a Approach.
A task can have multiple approaches and an approach belongs to a task

Anyone can browse  AZdev for tasks & approaches
Logged-in users can add new Tasks and Approaches as well as up-vote or down-vote approaches
The main entries for both tasks & approaches and user records are stored in PostgreSQL, while extra data elements like explanations, warnings and general notes will be stored in Mongo DB

The project is intended for demo purposes only so as to demonstrate the ability to perform certain GQL specific abilities  and is not a production ready web app.
